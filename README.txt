Jiffy Temporal Scheduler
------------------------

Jiffy is a temporal cooperative scheduler for musical applications. It can schedule computations along multiple symbolic timelines synchronized with each other using tempo curves. This allows to author and execute rich and open temporal scenarios to pilot sound effects, lights, mechatronics, etc.

User code is executed in fibers and can yield and request to be rescheduled at a later symbolic time, or wait until another fiber has completed. It can also request to be put in a background thread to execute blocking actions without blocking the cooperative scheduling.

Symbolic timescales are organized as a hierarchy: the symbolic time of a timescale is translated to the symbolic time of its parent (and to the real-time at the root of the hierarchy) using tempo curves. These curves are defined piecewise by linear or cubic BÃ©zier curves. Tempo can be specified either as a function of a timescale's symbolic time, or as a function of its parent's (more concrete) time.
