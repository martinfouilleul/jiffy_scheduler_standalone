[x] Re-integrate tempo curves
	[x] use only one timestamp structure only
	[x] review how we integrate curve -> maybe store timestamps for breakpoints?
	[x] rewrite sched_task_update_pos_from_sync_curve
	[x] Revert to using doubles for now

[x] Remove usage of dynamic array and remove dynarray from containers...
	[x] Treat curves as immutable
	[x] For now just malloc a full block + elements
	[x] Have a maximum number of sched handles slots and use a regular array + free list

[x] collect macro_helpers and math_helpers together
[x] Put platform-dependant fiber stuff in its own platform files

[.] Small examples
	[x] Add plot curve example
	[x] Add small tempo curve example

[.] Curve elements allocation
	- Pass a memory pool on allocation to allocate elements (but then elements have to be a linked list)
		 (not necessarily that bad since we have to do a linear search anyway?)
	- Pass a liner arena (but then we can't free curves at will...)
	- malloc a full block with curve + elements
